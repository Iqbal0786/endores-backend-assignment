#Deployed Link :https://endores-assignment.herokuapp.com/users
# I have created two end points -
1. get (/users): https://endores-assignment.herokuapp.com/users  this route will send response in an object containing two properties data and flattenedData and they will represent the normal and flattened data
2. post (/users) : https://endores-assignment.herokuapp.com/users here request body will accept json object and after creating new entry this will response newly created entry in flattended format

#Note : i have created  end point one for testing purpose that data is comming from backend or not and in response i have returned both normal data as well as flattened data what is asked
